# bmcc-robotics
code repo for the bmcc robotics team

feel free to comment, and collaborate as you please.
any final codes we will be using for testing and debugging will be in separate folders within the main directory
if anyone has time, could they possibly get the shared google drive folder and move all the documentation here?
