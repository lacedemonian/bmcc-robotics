TEST SENSORS PRIOR TO TUNING

1
Increment Kp until you get a somewhat steady follow
2
Decrement down to about half of that Kp
Increment Kd until you get an even steadier follow
3
Finally add in Ki (usually very very small, almost negligible. might need to increment at 0.0001)

Once you have Kp, Ki, Kd values that work for you, find a range between each of those values, and alter the code so you increment at 0.0001,
then play around with those values until you perfect the values for your needs.

Every robot is different, remember to work with varying base speeds and max speeds to better suit your needs ... for speeds

SIDE NOTE:
There are means to automatically tune your robot instead of incrementing at 0.0001.
Lets say you find a range around the following values after the manual test
Kp = 0.2 Kd = 0.5 Ki =0.01
Kp (0.1, 0.3) Kd (0.4, 0.6) Ki (0.001, 0.02)

If you were to automate a code to cycle through every possible value at increment values of 0.0000001,
keep that value for a few seconds, and record the least amount of error fluctuation as well as it's Kp Ki Kd for that
instance (essentially minimizing error),
then you could fine tune your line follow perfectly. Unfortunately this requires a long track. A long and straight track.
Perhaps a treadmill covered in white paper and a single black line in the middle of it would suffice?
For our purposes, however, fine tuning manually will have to do.
