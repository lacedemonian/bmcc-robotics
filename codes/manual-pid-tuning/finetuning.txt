TEST SENSORS PRIOR TO TUNING

1
Increment Kp until you get a somewhat steady follow
2
Decrement down to about half of that Kp
Increment Kd until you get an even steadier follow
3
Finally add in Ki (usually very very small, almost negligible. might need to increment at 0.0001)

Once you have Kp, Ki, Kd values that work for you, find a range between each of those values, and alter the code so you increment at 0.0001,
then play around with those values until you perfect the values for your needs.

Every robot is different, remember to work with varying base speeds and max speeds to better suit your needs ... for speeds
